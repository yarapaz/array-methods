## 🚀 How to run the Apps.

### Pre-requeriments

To start using this project clone this repo to a new directory.

> ```console
>  $ git clone https://github.com/yarapaz/array-methods.git
> ```

### ➡️ Start the project

> 👉 Open your localhost with Visual Code **Go Live** to view the app in the browser.

Once inside go to the **Devtools window** by right clicking on the page and selecting the **inspector** option. Once you are there, travel to the console tab on the top to be able to see all the results returned by the array methods applied.

In order to improve the experience I encourage you to open up **main.js** file at the same time in Visual Code to see each of the 8 exercises that have been performed and all the methods that have been applied to better understand the list of results returned in the console.

**Note: several ways to get every exercise have been written down so feel free to uncomment and prove every single one of them**

And that's all! Enjoy and have fun!
